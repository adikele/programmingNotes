PROBLEM STATEMENT:

This exercise was done as part of a course in Algorithms and Datastructures at Aalto University (Fall 2016).

A class implementing a minheap (used for a priority queue) was provided. The class can be used for simple prioritization tasks.
The task with the smallest integer has the highest priority.
For example, in the task queue [ (3, "Do homework"), (1, "Eat), (2, "Sleep") ] the task "Eat" has the highest priority.

Several of the methods needed by the minheap to work properly had not yet been implemented.
My task was to fix all the methods which begin with the comment: "Not Initially Implemented"


COMMENTS ON MY PROGRAM SOLUTION:
While working for a solution, I found a similar solution on the Web which had methods similar to the ones that I needed to implement.
https://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/Trees/BinaryHeapImplementation.html
I noted that in my problem's minheap class, there was no "zeroth" array element, while the one in the above link had it.

I developed my understanding of the minheap class by reading the discussion in the above link and then created the logic and code to write out the missing methods.

Additionally I wrote a few test scripts to check that the methods work as intended.
